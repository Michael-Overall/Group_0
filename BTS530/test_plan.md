# Test Plan

## Picking a Meeting

The following tests will be conducted in order to test the meet-picking tool:

* A user will try to pick a meeting without being logged-in
* A logged-in user, from a group that hasn't yet picked a meeting, will try to pick a meeting that is currently available
* A logged-in user, from a group that has already picked a meeting, will try to pick a meeting that is currently available
