# Proof of Concept

## Proof of Concept (POC) Name:
Picking a Meeting


## Functionality in this POC:
A student user that belongs to a BTS530 group will book a meeting for the group by selecting from meeting times that have been set up by the course instructor. The POC should include logic to ensure that only valid meeting bookings can be made.

## Data store:
All database tables required for the above functionality will be in place; the POC will update existing tables, no additional tables are necessary.

## Assumptions/Exclusions
The functionality to manage users, groups, sections and courses is not part of this POC. It is already in place.
